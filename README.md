# hello-world
This is the simplest, most basic hello world repository to get to know GitHub following the instructions at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Hello people of the world. I am just a person experimenting and learning. I would like to keep learning and get better with programming. I still have not looked up at Python, but I am planning to take a look and do some projects. Later, I will see if Python is a language I would like to continue using to make it one of my top language choices. I am still working on deciding on what to focus for my learning to get to an "expert" level. ;)

And, yes... I am new to GitHub.
